      <P>
        For a number of years Gaspare, supported his two oldest of his three
        children to participate in Go Kart racing, hoping that one day, they may
        be able to progress to a higher level of motorsport, however this again
        was to prove almost impossible due to lack of funds.
        <br /><br />
         Eventually his oldest son Piero Calandra continued racing but this
        finally came to an end, when father and son, decided rather to invest
        the funds and efforts on building the prototype P001.
