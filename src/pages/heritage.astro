      <P>
        For a number of years Gaspare, supported his two oldest of his three
        children to participate in Go Kart racing, hoping that one day, they may
        be able to progress to a higher level of motorsport.
        <br /><br />
         Eventually, his oldest son Piero Calandra continued racing, but this
        finally came to an end, when father and son, decided to invest their
        funds and efforts on building the prototype P001.
