        A chronological history of Gaspare Vittorio Calandra’s passion to
        achieve his childhood dream. His life always revolved around cars and
        the automotive world and always with an incredible passion for
        motorsport. A dream he always cherished, which finally became reality.
        <br /><br />
         After many years of research, work designing and sketching, a
        full-scale functional prototype is built and with 100% commitment from
        his son Piero, his dream, finally became reality in 2022…
