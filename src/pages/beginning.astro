        A chronological history of Gaspare Vittorio Calandra’s passion to
        achieve his childhood dream.
        <br /><br />
         His life always revolved around cars. With an incredible obsession for
        race cars, a dream he always cherished which finally has became reality.
        After many years of research, designing and sketching a full-scale
        functional prototype is built with 100% commitment from his son Piero,
        his dream finally becomes reality in 2022…
