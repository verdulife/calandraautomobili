    desc: "The calculations gone into the chassis and suspension have been meticulously revised and tested on the new space frame developed for the GPS and GPC which share the same double wishbone, monotube dampers and space framed chassis. The suspension geometry has been a key factor for high-speed cornering and, together with the F45%-R55% and a 50% L-R weight distribution, has made the GPSeries a brutal track car. A lightweight space frame configuration, to ensure an optimum stiffness and safety where each element in the chassis, has been positioned to give the perfect balance.",

All engine internals have been reengineered to gain the power and torque needed for the demanding needs of our customers. Hours of machining and calibrating race parts has delivered the reliability needed for the most extreme road and track demands. The GPSport and it’s 500Bhp engine, has been revised to give the perfect performance on road, making it also a daily driver for the motorsport enthusiasts. The cooling system has been carefully studied for minimum heat transfer, including a double intercooler package and with single radiator. A 6-speed manual Dog or Sequential gearbox are both available in for both versions.",
