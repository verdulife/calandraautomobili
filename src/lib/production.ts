    desc: "Designed fully in house with the highest detail and refinement. Achieving the maximum downforce without compromising design with aerodynamical elements, has been done to improve the overall package. The enormous rear wing generating up to 650Kg of down force, combined with the side spliters and front wheel arch vents, have helped improwed air Flow. The front and rear diffusors create the perfect vacuum for keeping the correct pressure underneath the car. These modifications have arrived for the driver to feel the need of agressivenes, downforce focusing and high speed track behavior.",

    desc: "The calculations gone into the chassis and suspension have been meticulously revised and tested on the new space frame developed for the GPS and GPC which share the same double wishbone, monotube dampers and space framed chassis. The suspension geometry has been a key factor for high-speed cornering and together with the 45%F-55%Rand a 50% L-R weight distribution, has made the GPSeries a brutal track car. A lightweight space frame configuration, to ensure an optimum stiffness and safety were each element in the chassis, has been positioned to give the perfect balance.",

The GPC internlas have been reenginered to gain the power and torque needed for the demanding needs of our customers. Hours of machining and calibrating race parts has delivered the reliability needed for the most extreme road and track demands. The GPS and it’s 500Bhp engine, has been revised to give the perfect performance on road and track. The cooling system has been carefully studied for minimum heat transfer including a double intercooler package and a single coolingradiator. A 6-speed manual dog or sequential gearbox are both available for both versions.",
